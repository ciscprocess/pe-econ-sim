# PE Economy Simulator Engine
The PE Economy Simulator is currently a proof-of-concept of an idea that Philip Enders had regarding the creation of a
simulation/strategy game with a more robust and realistic economy. Unlike the traditional RTS and Simulation models
where wealth is created directly from abstracted tax values or natural resources, this model attempts to approximate
an economy down to the physical sustenance level. 

## Design
A more complete, and regularly updated, description of the game design can be found [here](http://localhost/d).

## Developing Release: 0.1.0
The currently developing release will feature:
- Controllable Civilians
- Birthrate and an individual "Deathrate"
- Food and Wood Gathering
- Ticking Costs (each Civilian/Unit consumes one food per unit time)
- Pseudo-Random Terrain Generation with Desert, Plains, and Forest tiles using my quick and dirty Cluster Seeder v1
- Isometric Map
