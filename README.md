# PE Economy Simulator Engine
The PE Economy Simulator is currently a proof-of-concept of an idea that Philip Enders had regarding the creation of a

where wealth is created directly from abstracted tax values or natural resources, this model attempts to approximate
an economy down to the physical sustenance level.
